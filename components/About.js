        Hello! <br /> <br />
        I am a designer / developer hybrid and enjoy crafting functional and
        aesthetic digital solutions, by means of design and code.
        <br /> <br />
        I have been obsessed with everything design for as long as I can
        remember and have freelanced for brands around the world designing
        identities, products and experiences.
        <br /> <br />
        After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, I joined
        Amazon, where I am focusing on design systems and tooling for front-end
        development.
        <br /> <br />
        Hit me up, if you’d like to work on a project with me or just say hello,
        <br />
